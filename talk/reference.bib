 ISSN = {00031305},
 abstract = {The alias method of Walker is a clever, new, fast method for generating random variables from an arbitrary, specified discrete distribution. A simple probabilistic proof is given, in terms of mixtures, that the method works for any discrete distribution with a finite number of outcomes. A more efficient version of the table-generating portion of the method is described. Finally, a brief discussion on efficiency of the method is given. We believe that the generality, speed, and simplicity of the method make it attractive for use in generating discrete random variables.},
